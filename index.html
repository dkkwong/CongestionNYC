                    <h2>What is Congestion Pricing?</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Under New York's congestion pricing plan drivers will have to pay a toll to drive through lower Manhattan. The price of the toll will be higher during daytime and lower at night.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Drivers will only be charged once per day for entering or staying within the congestion zone.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The plan is estimated to generate 1 Billion for the MTA. 80% will go for subways and buses, 10% to the LIRR, and 10% to the Metro North.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Congestion pricing in New York is currently planned to be implemented mid 2023</p>

                    <h2>Why does New York City need it?</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>A golbal traffic survey by INRIX found that New York City had the worst traffic on the continent in 2021.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Before COVID the MTA estimated average traffic speeds within the proposed congestion zone were just 7MPH.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This traffic results in millions of hours lost for New Yorkers and over $8 Billion in cost for the city, which doesn't include damages from traffic accidents or the increased air pollution.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>New York City's plan is based on sucessful congestion pricing plans in London, Singapore, Stockholm, and Milan. These cities saw ~25% drop in traffic after their plans were enacted.</p>

                    <h2>Who will be affected?</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Residents making less than $60,000 who live in the congestion zone will be <b>refunded</b> any extra cost in the form of a state tax credit. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Most commuters do not drive to Lower Manhattan.The MTA estimates 75%-80% of commuters currently use alternative forms of transportation. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>All New Yorkers will benefit from reduced air pollution, traffic noise, and increased speeds.</p>
